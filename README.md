## I. INTRODUCTION

```
The MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox provides a
multitude of included image manipulation commands that are
useful for Computer Vision scientists. This report will first
explore the commands included that allow for the
manipulation of image contrast through Histogram of
Intensities equalization Next, commands that enhance and
detect edges in images through different included algorithms
will be explored, including the Roberts’ Cross method to
reveal and enhance edges, and the Canny algorithm to reveal
both strong and weak edges in an image. Finally, this report
will explore the use of median and Gaussian noise filters to
clarify images subjected to different intensities of noise.
```
## II. EQUALIZING THE HISTOGRAM OF INTENSITIES TO EVEN OUT IMAGE CONTRAST

```
A. Defining the Histogram of Intensities & Image Contrast
In MATLAB, greyscale images are described as 2-
dimensional matrices, which can be visualized using a
histogram. The histogram generated from MATLAB image
data describes the “intensity” of each pixel in the image in
relation to surrounding data points. In relation to images, this
is analogous to image contrast, which describes the difference
in color (or gray levels in this case) that make an object
distinguishable.
First, an example image will be shown alongside its
respective Histogram of Intensities, where then the image will
be equalized using the MATLAB command histeq, which
equalizes the Histogram of Intensities to resemble a uniform
distribution, which in turn provides equal contrast to all pixels
in the image [1].
```
```
B. Generating the Histogram of Intensities for the Original
Image
```
```
The following image will be used to demonstrate the
effects of Histogram of Intensities equalization:
```
```
Figure 1: Original photo that will be equalized, “cat.jpg.”
The resulting Histogram of Intensities from this
photo’s MATLAB data is as follows:
```
```
Figure 2: Resulting Histogram of Intensities from Figure 1.
C. Generating the Equalized Image and Corresponding
Histogram of Intensities
Using the histeq command, the following equalized
Histogram of Intensities is generated:
```
```
Figure 3: Equalized Histogram of Intensities for Figure 4.
```

```
This results in the following generated image:
```
```
Figure 4: Equalized form of “cat.jpg” generated from the
histeq command
As seen in Figure 4, the histeq command successful
equalizes the contrast of images by making direct
manipulations to their underlying matrix data in the MATLAB
workspace, which is an efficient means to ensure edges can be
properly detected by other commands within the Toolbox.
```
## III. SHARPENING IMAGES TO REDUCE BLUR/ENHANCE EDGES

```
A. Introduction
Before continuing on to explore the algorithms available
to detect and enhance edges, MATLAB’s ability to sharpen
images will be explored, which is a quick and computationally
lax means to reduce blur in images, as well as emphasize
edges in a blurry image. This is possible through the Image
Processing Toolbox’s imsharpen command, which uses
unsharp masking to emphasize borders around objects in
images, which in turn reduces blur in those areas [2]. Under
the hood of this algorithm is the use of a Gaussian Low-Pass
Filter, which can be used to filter fuzz in images.
```
```
B. Using the imsharpen Command
The following photo will be used to demonstrate the
effects of using the imsharpen command:
```
```
Figure 5: Photo that will be sharpened, “blurryDog.jpg”
Note that Figure 5 is a slightly blurry image on purpose, and
imsharpen will be used to reduce blur around the main object
in the image (the dog) which will emphasize the edges around
them as well.
The following image is created by sending Figure 5
through the imsharpen command:
```
```
Figure 6: Sharpened version of “blurryDog.jpg” resulting
from the execution of the imsharpen command.
As seen from Figure 6, imsharpen provides a quick and
easy way to reduce fuzz and blur in images, which in turn
enhances the edges of the image for later computations.
```
```
## IV. ENHANCING EDGES USING THE ROBERTS CROSS
ALGORITHM
```
```
A. Introduction
In MATLAB, the Roberts Cross algorithm can be used to
reveal the major edges in a photo, which then can be used
with later computations for various tasks. This is possible
using the edge command in the Image Processing Toolbox,
which provides various algorithms to detect and enhance
edges of images [3]. Alongside the Roberts Cross algorithm,
the edge command also includes the Sobel algorithm, the
Prewitt algorithm, the Laplacian of Gaussian algorithm, the
zerocross method, and the Canny algorithm.
The Roberts Cross algorithm uses the Roberts
approximation to the derivative to generate the edges around
the main object in the image.
```
```
B. Using the Roberts Cross Algorithm to Reveal/Emhance
the Main Edges in an Image
The following image will be used to demonstrate the
output of the Roberts Cross algorithm:
```
```
Figure 7: Image that will be used in the Roberts Cross
algorithm edge enhancement, “flower.jpg” Note that images
must be in greyscale to meet the appropriate matrix size
restrictions.
```

```
The following image is created by the algorithm:
```
```
Figure 8: Output of the Roberts Cross algorithm, which
reveals the main edges of the main object in the photo, which
is the outer border of the flower.
```
```
As seen from Figure 8, the Roberts Cross algorithm
successfully reveals the main edges of the image, as expected.
The results of this algorithm can be used in later computations
that require the knowledge of where the edges in an image are
located.
```
## V. DETECTING MAIN AND WEAK EDGES IN AN IMAGE USING THE CANNY ALGORITHM

```
A. Introduction
In addition to the Roberts Cross algorithm, the Canny
algorithm can also be used to detect edges in an image. In
comparison to other algorithms available for use in the edge
command, the Canny algorithm provides more robust results,
reveals weak edges that are not normally detected or
enhanced by other algorithms, including the Roberts Cross
algorithm.
The Canny algorithm finds edges my looking for local
maxima in the gradient of the image, which are found by
taking the derivative of a Gaussian filter. Two thresholds are
used in this algorithm to respectively detect strong (main) and
weak edges, as well as weak edges that are connected to
strong edges. The use of two thresholds is the main reason
behind the Canny algorithm’s robustness in detecting edges
in images.
```
```
B. Using the Canny Algorithm to Detect Edges
Figure 7 will be used to demonstrate the output of the
Canny algorithm, to allow for comparisons between the
Canny and Roberts Cross algorithms. The output of Figure 7
being subjected to the Canny algorithm is as follows:
```
```
Figure 9: Output of the Canny algorithm, which reveals both
main and weak edges in an image. This includes the petals of
the flower, as well as the veins slightly shown within the
leaves.
```
```
As seen by Figure 9, the Canny algorithm proves to be a
more robust method of revealing all edges in an image, while
the Roberts Cross algorithm is a good method for revealing
only the outer borders of the main object in an image.
```
## VI. FILTERING IMAGE NOISE USING MEDIAN AND GAUSSIAN FILTERS

```
A. Introduction
Within the Image Processing Toolbox are various
methods to filter unwanted image noise, which is defined as
any pixel definition that is an unintended result. Two main
filter types that are available for use are median and Gaussian
filters.
Median filters perform filtering of an image by creating
the output value of each pixel the median value in a 3x
neighborhood around the pixel. For small amounts of signal
noise, this method is extremely efficient.
Gaussian filters use a 2D Gaussian smoothing kernel with
a default standard deviation of 0.5 to return each output pixel.
This method is efficient in generating image blur as well as
removing various levels of noise. MATLAB can implement
a Gaussian filter using the imgaussfilt command, and a
median filter using the medfilt2 command. [4] [5].
```
```
B. Using Median Filters on Noise-afflicted Images
To demonstrate the output of median filters on noisy
images, the following image will be used:
```

Figure 10: Greyscale version of “dandelion.jpg,” which will
be used to demonstrate the output of median and Gaussian
image filters.

To demonstrate its noise filtering abilities, Figure 10 will
first be subjected to artificial “salt and pepper” noise at SNR
levels of 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08, respectively:

Figure 11: Figure 10 subjected to “salt and pepper” noise at
SNR = 0.

Figure 12: Figure 10 subjected to “salt and pepper” noise at
SNR = 0.

```
Figure 13: Figure 10 subjected to “salt and pepper” noise at
SNR = 0.
```
```
The following images result from subjecting Figures 11
through 13 to a median image filter:
```
```
Figure 14: Output of Figure 11 being subjected to a median
image filter.
```
```
Figure 15: Output of Figure 12 being subjected to a median
image filter.
```
```
Figure 16: Output of Figure 13 being subjected to a median
filter.

As seen from Figures 14 through 16, median filters are a
robust method of reducing noise, especially at low SNR
levels. For images afflicted by higher levels of SNR, other
filtering methods may be necessary.

C. Using Gaussian Filters on Noise-afflicted Images

To demonstrate the output of Gaussian filters on noisy
images, Figure 10 will be used to allow for comparisons of
results between median and Gaussian filters. Salt and pepper
noise at SNR levels of 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 will be used once
again to demonstrate the differences between the two filters;
Figures 11 through 13 demonstrate what images will be
subjected to a Gaussian filter.
The following images result from subjecting Figures 11
through 13 to a Gaussian image filter:

Figure 17: Output of Figure 11 being subjected to a Gaussian
filter with 0.5 standard deviation.

```
```
Figure 18: Output of Figure 12 being subjected to a Gaussian
filter with 0.5 standard deviation.
```
```
Figure 19: Output of Figure 13 being subjected to a Gaussian
filter with 0.5 standard deviation.
```
```
As seen by Figures 17 through 19, Gaussian filters
provide a somewhat robust method for reducing noise. It’s
efficiency in reducing noise may also vary by the type of
noise applied and is evidently not as efficient in removing salt
and pepper noise compared to median filters.
```

## VII. CONCLUSION
```
In conclusion, the MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox
includes an amass of tools to manipulate images as necessary,
including contrast balancing, edge detection and
enhancement and noise filtering. These tools are important
starting points for later computations that this course will
explore.
